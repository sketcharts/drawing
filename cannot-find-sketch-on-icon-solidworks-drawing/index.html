<section><h3>I Was Thinking It Might Have Been A File Reference Thing, But I Cannot Find A Category For Sketch Picture.</h3><br/><p>I cannot find the exit sketch icon in the the sketch tollbar or anywhere else. Default templates go to tools &gt; options &gt; systems options &gt; default templates there are 3 default templates: I have a user that is have problems selecting a plane on parts unless there is a piece of the plane not enveloped by the part.</p><h3>Multiple Disjoint Closed Is Displayed As The Contour Type.</h3><br/><p>Select the spiral and convert entities. Your parts are not completely loaded because the assembly is huge (i suppose). If you open the parts where you need the sketch, then will this part completely loaded and you will see the sketch in assembly too.</p><h3>To Modify The Spline Leader, Select The Note And Drag The Control Vertex Points.</h3><br/><p>I don&#039;t know why the sketch ones are missing but they are. In solidworks, there are times when you are modifying an existing part and that part has external references. Answered on 6 dec, 2013 09:16 am.</p><h3>I&#039;ve Tried Both Jpg And Tiff Images And They Both Have This Problem.</h3><br/><p>I can add a command bar in the taskbar using the tools menu but the icons are smaller, the other way was better and it was the factory default setting so they should be there( see attached.jpeg) So we will peruse the settings to toggle the behavior. I have gone into tools&gt;options, system option tab, general category and checked the enable confirmation corner box.</p><h3>Go To View &gt; Toolbars And Check If Enabling Any Of The Listed Toolbars Displays The Icon.</h3><br/><p>I am making a assembly drawing, with a drawing view as shown in image below. For those of you looking for the quickest tip you’ll ever receive, simply press the f6 key in solidworks and then move the cursor to get rid of this icon. The explorer only shows a generic icon for all files associated with solidworks.</p></section><section><aside><img title="The Fastest Way To Add Smart Dimensions In Solidworks" alt="The Fastest Way To Add Smart Dimensions In Solidworks" rel="nofollow" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.solidworks.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/4-17.png" rel="nofollow"width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><center><small><i>Images: google.com</i></small></center><br><p>Selection filter selection filters help select specific types of items in the graphics area or drawing sheet.
