<section><h3>I’m Going To Use A Trick:</h3><br/><p>Position the pointer where you want the line to begin, and drag to where you want the line to end. Overlapping sketch lines and arcs repair sketch will automatically merge these into a single entity and will not return a message about this action. Use intersection for the type of split, and pick the faces that intersect with the plane.</p><h3>I Have Placed The Sketch Both On The Part Surface And The Datum Plane.</h3><br/><p>Select ctrl+a to select all. (clear) delete an image from memory.(load) will load image into the drawing area. If anyone has a fix to this, please let me know.</p><h3>Go Simple And Classic With A White Or Black Line, Or Choose A More Vibrant Color, Like Neon Yellow Or Bright Pink.</h3><br/><p>Called up other drawings that were referenced to models in other projects.try to select a line entity, or vertex points, to dimension.and nothing. When working on a sketch, sketch objects are not able to be selected in fusion 360. If you click on a saved image (in a box), the image from the drawing area will take its place, as a new recording.</p><h3>Although I Can&#039;t Figure Out What Caused It, I Can Remedy It In The Drawing.</h3><br/><p>Was dimensioning a drawing, then went to dimension to a line and sw would not select the line. Of course, since i don’t want to go through all that just for this one line, and have to change it back again afterwards; Basically this is making a drawing that i spend about 10 hours on useless becuase i have extra lines flying around that i can&#039;t delete.</p><h3>Simply Draw The Line, Shape, Or Guide, Then Press Escape.</h3><br/><p>As you can see in the attached photo, i have drawn the profile that i need to revolve, and i have drawn a construction line down the middle of the cylinder that i would like to use as my axis of rev. Use the toolbar to select the workspace you want to work in, and the tool you want to use in the workspace selected. Because repair sketch does not return a message about the two points mentioned, it could be that you start the repair sketch tool and immediately see the no problems found message.</p></section><section><aside><img title="hat&#039;s your favourite medium and why? .
