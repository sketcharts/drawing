<section><h3>Using The Information Obtained From Steps A To G, We Can Sketch The Curve.</h3><br/><p>However, i try to be careful to not make them too big as to not “clog” the picture! Sketch the curve between the points, using the intervals of increase and decrease and intervals of concavity. Decide on how many points your leaf will have, and then start drawing curved lines to connect the steam to each leaf;</p><h3>The Total Length Is Known Because The Radius Of The Curve On The Left Side Is Given.</h3><br/><p>This will give us the sketch of level curves of the function. You can draw thick and long eyelashes to give a feminine look to the character of your drawing.
