<section><h3>In The Featuremanager Design Tree, Select The Same Sketch Used To Create The First Feature.</h3><br/><p>Solidworks features contain intelligence so they can be edited. Select a sketch in the featuremanager design tree. You can also create a sketch on a flat surface, a spline on a surface, or the face of a solid.</p><h3>The Way That Solidworks Works Is That If The Sketch Is Set To “Show”, In Other Words, If The Sketch Was Not Hidden In The Part Level, It Will Show In All Drawing Views At The Drawing Level.</h3><br/><p>This can be in the same file or a different open file. Click sketch picture (sketch toolbar) or insert > picture. I'm using the drawing to save in.dxf format and i do not need a 3d rendering just the sketch entities.</p><h3>You Can Sketch Entities Approximately, Then Dimension The Entities Exactly.</h3><br/><p>You should see a totally detached duplicate of the sketch entities you copied now placed in the target area. Create a feature from the sketch. Some people want to change a line style, some may want to change a thickness, and some may just want to hide.</p><h3>Sometimes The Centerlines Are Fine, Other Times You Must Rebuild Them.</h3><br/><p>Click on line command in sketch tab. To start the drawin skecthes with line command, click on the sketch button as shown by red arrow above in solidworks. When developing models in solidworks, you sketch geometric entities (such as rectangles and circles) as the basis for solid features (such as extrusions, revolves, and cuts).</p><h3>In The Dialog Box, Browse To An Image File, Then Click Open.</h3><br/><p>To create a drawing from within a part or assembly document: Select options for sheet format/size, then click ok. You can add additional sketches as required to create the features.</p></section><section><aside><img title="SolidWorks Sketch 2D Technical Drawing/Drafting" alt="SolidWorks Sketch 2D Technical Drawing/Drafting" rel="nofollow" src="https://i2.wp.com/d2t1xqejof9utc.cloudfront.net/pictures/files/135905/original.png?1527670944" rel="nofollow"width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><center><small><i>Images: bing.com</i></small></center><br><p>Drawings always say underdefined (unless you sketch some extra geometry and fully tie that sketch to the part).

Having that sketch shown in all views may cause some issues and for that reason we set any sketches that were not used for feature creation to “hide” in the part level.
