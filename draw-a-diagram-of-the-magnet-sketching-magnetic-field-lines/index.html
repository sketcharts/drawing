<section><h3>Magnetic Field Magnet Flux Diagram Drawing</h3><br/><p>Asked jul 29, 2019 in class x science by aditya23 expert (73.6k points) draw a diagram to show the magnetic field lines around. The tangent to the field line at any point represents the direction of the net magnetic field b at that point. Asked sep 29, 2018 in physics by sagarmatha ( 54.5k points)</p><h3>S A) Draw A Sketch Of The Predicted.</h3><br/><p>You will draw magnetic field diagrams and discuss the magnetic field around both a permanent magnet and a solencid. A small compass will point in the direction of the field line. Then determine which end of the wire is positive and which must be negative (label) 3.</p><h3>In Order To Picture The Magnetic Field And Its Strength At Different Distances From The Poles, It Is Convenie12341 To Show The Field As Lines Of Force, Generally Known As Magnetic Lines Of Force.</h3><br/><p>In following figure, draw at least two magnetic field lines between the two magnets. (ii) this principle is utilised to magnetise a piece of magnetic material like soft iron when placed inside the coil. Consider a permanent bar magnet as shown below.</p><h3>Magnetic Fields Can Be Mapped Out Using Small Plotting Compasses:</h3><br/><p>The magnetic field lines do not intersect each other. Put the bar magnet on the table and spread the iron filings near the magnet, the iron filings are able to align themselves in a different curved lines. Complete the diagrams below by adding in the compass arrows based on the one compass given.</p><h3>The Following Are The Properties Of Magnetic Lines:</h3><br/><p>(ii) outside the magnet, the magnetic field lines are directed from north pole of magnet towards south pole. Draw a diagram to show the magnetic field lines around a bar magnet. The magnetic lines move from the north to the south pole outside the magnet.</p></section><section><aside><img title="Physics Unit 11 / Look Good &amp; Study Hard" alt="Physics Unit 11 / Look Good &amp; Study Hard" rel="nofollow" src="https://i2.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-zCUjJw-pbmA/VkwBrMQFvoI/AAAAAAAACVc/eQIU7HhHuZU/s1600/magneticfield4.gif" rel="nofollow"width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><center><small><i>Images: pinterest.com</i></small></center><br><p>Figure 6 two magnets with like poles facing each other.
