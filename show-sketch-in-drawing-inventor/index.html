Inventor removes the portion of the model facing you, revealing the plane for the sketch geometry.</p><h3>Show Me How To Create A Breakout Using Through Part Method (Not Available In Inventor Lt)</h3><br/><p>Creating sketch geometry within inventor typically takes on a completely different approach than in autocad. In part or assembly environments, existing sketches can be copied and pasted onto different planes or faces. The following image shows how model geometry can be projected into a sketch.</p><h3>To Display The Model Sketch With Default Attributes, Open The Source Model File, Select Formatting Toggle In The Sketch Properties Toolbar, And Then Reapply Model Properties In The Drawing.</h3><br/><p>If you create a sketch in the drawing, it is not possible to make additional views from this sketch. For a view of a sheet metal part, only the model sketches in one of the models (folded model or flat pattern model) can be recovered. Other entities (lines, circles, etc.):</p><h3>If The Hole Feature Is Hidden, Click Show Hidden Edges To Show It Temporarily.</h3><br/><p>Only sketches that are parallel to the view can be displayed. The sketch becomes the basis. Move / moves selected sketch geometry from point to point, or move a copy of the geometry.</p><h3>You Can Show Unconsumed And Consumed Sketches From A Model In A Drawing View Of The Model.</h3><br/><p>This is used to keep track of approval and who has seen or edited the part. Select ok and finish sketch.
