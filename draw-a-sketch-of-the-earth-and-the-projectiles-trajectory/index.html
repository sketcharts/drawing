Then draw a motion diagram for the horizontal motion of the ball. Sketch such a trajectory and explain why you have drawn it that way.</p><h3>At This Point, The X Component Of The Velocity Becomes Negative.</h3><br/><p>The major force acting on a projectile is the force of gravity. On the other hand, the horizontal acceleration is 0 m/s/s and the projectile continues with a constant horizontal velocity throughout its entire trajectory. Elements may be used by teachers, while students may use the whole package for self instruction or for reference.</p><h3>(A)How Far From The Center Of The Earth Does The Projectile Rise?</h3><br/><p>Include units on both axes.
