If you create a sketch in a drawing, view > hide/show > sketches does not affect the sketch’s visibility. For example, if you look at my first image, we see that this part has an appearance applied at the part level.</p><h3>To Completely Get To The Bottom Of This, We Would Probably Need To Start Tracking Specifically Which Version Of Solidworks (And Sp) And What Type Of Image File Is Being Used (Gif, Jpeg, Bmp, Whatever), As Well As Method For Inserting The Image Into The Drawing.</h3><br/><p>Fiddling with opengl makes no difference.

I also went to the system options/assemblies to see if the box for 'hide all planes,axes,sketches.' was checked and it is not checked. There are many causes that make thumbnails not appear in sketchup, one of them is the version of the sketchup file that we have is not the same as the version of sketchup that we use.
