It is therefore not surprising that memory t cells, like naïve t cells, display in general a catabolic metabolism, relying essentially on oxidation of glucose and fatty acids , ().yet, memory t cells have several characteristics which distinguish them metabolically from naïve t cells. Hence, they are known as the building blocks of life.
