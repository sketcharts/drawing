And even though it might look a little complicated, we&#039;re just going to begin by drawing the top, which is simply a polygon shape very similar to the ones we drew in the polygon exercise. “i let the inner strands run into each other,” lamb says.</p><h3>This Arm Can Come Down And Then We Have Feet, Feet, Little Head.</h3><br/><p>The length of the vectors will not be graded. This is an example of the line of action being drawn before anything else. To keep this demonstration simple i&#039;m drawing a figure from the front standing fairly straight up.</p></section><section><aside><img title="Character pose sketch by TheRetroSpecter on DeviantArt" alt="Character pose sketch by TheRetroSpecter on DeviantArt" rel="nofollow" src="https://i2.wp.com/img00.deviantart.net/67e3/i/2012/172/b/7/character_pose_sketch_by_retrospektre-d54bgg2.png" rel="nofollow"width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><center><small><i>Images: pinterest.com</i></small></center><br><p>I&#039;m just going to do a couple of lines like this and then have a point here, and that will come straight up to the point.
